# Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning Projects (A.A. 2019/2020)

Authors: Francesco Alongi, Gerlando Re.

This repository contains the projects for the Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning Course. For all these projects we used Tensorflow 2.1.0 (all requirements are listed in the ``requirements.txt`` file). </br>

### Project #1: Image Classification Network

The first project was an __Object Recognition__ challenge in which we had to build a CNN classifier. The dataset was composed of images representing 20 different types of objects (airplanes, bulbs...) also with an unbalancement in number of samples.

### Project #2: Image Segmentation Network

The second project had the purpose of getting acquainted with the __Image Segmentation__ problem, which consists in selecting the pixel space within the image in which a specific object "lies". For this network we did some litterature research in order to study effective models to solve the problems (_U-net_ etc.)
